# Image Segmentation Parallelisation

This project was for my HPC course, where we aimed to exploit the highly parallelizable aspect of image processing by parallellizing several image segmentation algorithms. This was done using CUDA, OpenMP and MPI, and the algorithms were benchmarked against their respective serial implementations.

Algorithms that were used are namely the K-Means Clustering, Nick Thresholding and Canny Edge Detection algorithms.
